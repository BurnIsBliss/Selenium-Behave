# Selenium-Behave

Short project to demonstrate my skills in Selenium with Python Behave (BDD).

I learnt the following topics while doing this tiny project:

1. Feature files
2. Steps directory
3. Gherkin syntax: Feature, Scenario, Given, When, Then, And, Background
4. Running tests
5. Allure reports
